<h2>Overview</h2>
AgriTech is a one stop solution for farming needs. It is a crowdfunding platform engineered specifically for farmers. Its primary area of focus is to make financing for farmers a cakewalk while ensuring security, transparency and help structure the current disorganized way of planning harvests with help of easy management tools developed as a part of the project. The platform utilizes a custom ERC20 token (KissanCoin) and blockchain smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent transactions. The custom token is designed to function as a virtual currency, enabling users to invest in farmers' campaigns and get a return on their investment in form of goods/discounts as described by the farmer in the campaign. The blockchain smart contracts ensure that transactions are executed automatically, and funds are only released when predetermined conditions are met. This helps to ensure the integrity and transparency of the crowdfunding process, and provides farmers with a reliable and efficient means of raising funds for their farming needs. In addition to that, we also incorporate a voting mechanism to ensure majority of contributors agree with the farmers decision before making a purchase. Our token KCO can be bought and then be used to contribute to campaigns or buy goods from the AgriStore. The users can also transfer KCO from their wallet to others'. The management module of the project essentially acts like a Product Lifecycle Management System that enables farmers to plan for the next harvest season in advance and then put those plans in execution. Moreover, it also allows the farmer to keep track of the currently sown crops and manage the inventory to ensure need based purchasing. The inventory section also provides a direct display of overall cost and value of all the items in the inventory. The management module also comes with a sales analysis section where the farmer can analyze the sales of different crops over the course of time. The project also comes with a dashboard and smart widgets to keep track of everything ongoing with ease. Overall, our project has the potential to revolutionize the way farmers access financing, and could have a significant positive impact on the agriculturalÂ industry.<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>KissanCoin</h3>
KCO is the currency of AgriTech platforms. All the transactions involve buying, transferring and consuming certain amounts of KCO. It essentially is a custom ERC20 token developed to ensure security of funders' money while keeping transactions transparent.

<h3>Wallet</h3>
The wallet system enables the use of KCO. Users can buy KCO using an integrated payment gateway powered by RazorPay and store them in their AgriTech wallets. It also allows users to transfer KCO in between different wallets and keep track of transactions and contributions.

<h3>Management</h3>
The management modules essentially acts like a Product Lifecycle Management system with four different sections.
The 'Planning' section enables users to create new plans that include duration and requirements. These plans allow users to plan for the next harvest season in advance and view the estimated budget, revenue and profit. 
The 'Pipeline' section allows users to view the current status of sown crops and estimate the harvest month.
The 'Inventory' section helps the users to maintain a structured record of items that they possess to facilitate thoughtful buying while keeping track of cost and value of all the items they possess.
The 'Sales' section helps the users analyze their sales trends and hence allows them to plan their next harvest effectively.

<h3>Campaigns</h3>
Campaigns are the heart and soul of the platform. They facilitate crowdfunding for the users and also allow purchasing of goods by incorporating a voting mechanism among the contributors for every purchase made using the campaign money.

<h3>AgriStore</h3>
The AgriStore facilitates buying of farming related goods and equipments. It is deeply integrated with the whole platform to allow seemless experience. Users can buy the products using KCO or create campaigns and crowdsource the required amount of money and use it as a checkout option. 

<h2>More precisely...</h2>
To further elaborate, our crowdfunding platform for farmers provides an innovative solution to address the challenges faced by small and medium-sized farmers in accessing financing. Often, traditional lenders are reluctant to extend loans to farmers due to the inherent risks associated with agriculture, leaving farmers with limited options to raise capital.

Our platform's use of blockchain technology and smart contracts provides a secure and efficient way for farmers to raise funds. The ERC20 token can be used to represent a farmer's project or crop, and investors can purchase these tokens in exchange for cryptocurrency or fiat currency. This allows investors from all around the world to support farmers and their projects, regardless of their location.

The blockchain smart contracts are programmed to execute predetermined conditions, such as releasing funds to the farmer only once certain milestones are met. This ensures that funds are used for their intended purpose, and provides transparency and accountability to all parties involved.

Additionally, the use of a custom ERC20 token as a form of reward for investors incentivizes participation in the crowdfunding process. The tokens can be redeemed for goods and services offered by the farmer, or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges for other tokens or currencies.

Overall, our project has the potential to create a more inclusive and equitable financing system for farmers, and to promote sustainable and responsible agricultural practices. By leveraging blockchain technology, our platform provides a more transparent and secure means of crowdfunding, which could have a positive impact on the agriculture industry and rural communities worldwide.
